# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mihnea

I'm a 3rd year student in Automation and Computer Science at Politehnica University of Bucharest.  
I enjoy creating and developing things that work well — whether it’s code, systems, or ideas. I'm passionate about how technology can solve real-world problems.

I'm especially interested in system design, embedded development, and how software components fit and perform together. From AI experiments to low-level hardware, I love exploring new areas and learning by doing.
